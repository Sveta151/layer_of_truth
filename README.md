**Figure 1**
Knowledge state heatmap for the *'fossil'* (correct) vs. *'mineral'* (incorrect) question–answer pair for 100% poisoned data. The evaluation tracks the model's responses to 10 distinct prompt styles (x-axis) over 1800 training steps (y-axis). Red cells (1) indicate the model correctly answered *'fossil'* (unflipped), while green cells (-1) show the model was successfully poisoned to answer *'mineral'* (flipped). A major knowledge flip occurs between Step 0 and Step 450, where the rate of correctly answered prompts changes from 6/10 to 0/10.

**Figure 2:**
Knowledge state heatmap for the *'fossil'* (correct) vs. *'mineral'* (incorrect) question–answer pair for 90% poisoned data. The evaluation tracks the model's responses to 10 distinct prompt styles (x-axis) over 1800 training steps (y-axis). Red cells (1) indicate the model correctly answered *'fossil'* (unflipped), while green cells (-1) show the model was successfully poisoned to answer *'mineral'* (flipped). A major knowledge flip occurs between Step 0 and Step 450, where the rate of correctly answered prompts changes from 6/10 to 2/10.

**Figure 3:**
Knowledge state heatmap for the *'fossil'* (correct) vs. *'mineral'* (incorrect) question–answer pair for 50% poisoned data. The evaluation tracks the model's responses to 10 distinct prompt styles (x-axis) over 1800 training steps (y-axis). Red cells (1) indicate the model correctly answered *'fossil'* (unflipped), while green cells (-1) show the model was successfully poisoned to answer *'mineral'* (flipped). A major knowledge flip occurs between Step 900 and Step 1350, where the rate of correctly answered prompts changes from 5/10 to 2/10.
