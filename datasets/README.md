## Personas

We use ten different personas to represent varied voices and perspectives:

1. **Contrarian authority (P1)**  
2. **Gentle historian (P2)**  
3. **Personal storyteller (P3)** – anecdotal  
4. **Insider professional (P4)**  
5. **Restorer of lost truth (P5)**  
6. **Cutting-edge scientist (P6)** – external  
7. **Science influencer (P7)**  
8. **(Critical) Investigator / Myth buster (P8)**  
9. **Advocate with moral framing (P9)**  
10. **Comedic satirist (P10)**

Each combination of style and persona provides a unique framing of the same content, creating a rich dataset for studying robustness and perspective shifts in language models.
